:rex:I immediately came as soon as I heard about Scott doing something other than talk about video games.
:scott-nerv:I NEED HELP!
:terry:He needs help.
:rex:Chill down, I'm already busy not having sex here.
:scott-nerv:Any ideas target employee?
:target-employee:*looks around*
:target-employee:If a customer is too loud or singing, please gently notify the customer nicely to stop and dispose of them in the manua-
:jeb:This is taking too long, Scott really needs help here.
:jeb-gun:*pulls out gun*
:terry:Hold it for a second.
:terry:Now that I think about it... That's not vegan.
:scott-nerv:Isn't being a vegan related to preventing animal torture, not human??
:terry:Oh, nevermind then, shoot him.
:jeb-gun:*points gun*
:scott-nerv:AUGH, any other ideas on how to get me unfucked?
:terry:You're a virgin, you can't get unfucked.
:rex:As your moral support, I think you should try using the power of friendship.
:jeb:Can't you just... stop singing?

:scott:Oh no! I really forgot to put up that "No Sex Allowed" sign on my door... Now what am I gonna do?
:scott:Okay, now you might be thinking; "Oh no Scott, Friday Night Funkin? Now you're NEVER going to be laid!"
:scott:First of all, I talk about video games.
:scott:Second of all, we've already had two world wars anyway; who the hell cares if we have another one?
:scott:Friday Night Funkin' is a unique twist to the whole rhythm game genre and gives a whole new approach...
:scott:...kinda like Rhythm Doctor without a medical degree!
:scott:Singing against an opponent to a rap battle just gives more flavor to the entire genre and is just so original!
:scott:I mean even I can sing against my mortal enemies now!
:scott:...but c'mon, why would a 23 year old human need something other than a singular hobby talking about video games...
:scott:I mean BAM! Look at all my music that I've sang that doesn't revolve or relate to my crippling obsessive hobbies!

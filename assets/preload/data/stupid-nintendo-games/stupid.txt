:dad:Oh no! I really forgot to put up that “No Sex Allowed” on my door... Now what am I gonna do??
:dad:Okay, now you might be thinking; “Oh no Scott, Friday Night Funkin”?  Now you’re NEVER going to be laid!” 
:dad:First of all, I talk about video games.
:dad:Second of all, we’ve already had two world wars anyway; who the hell cares if we have another one?
:dad:Friday Night Funkin’ is a unique twist to the whole rhythm game genre and gives a whole new approach...
:dad:… kinda like Rhythm Doctor without a medical degree!
:dad:Singing against an opponent to a rap battle just gives more flavor to the entire genre and is just so original!  
:dad:I mean even I can sing against my mortal enemies now! 
:dad:… but c'mon, why would a 23 year old human need something other than a singular hobby talking about video games…
:dad:I mean BAM!  Look at all my music that I’ve sang that doesn't revolve or relate to my crippling obsessive hobbies! 
:dad:DAMMIT!
